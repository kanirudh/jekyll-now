Consider a variation of the Knapsack problem where we have two knapsacks, with integer capacities and . As usual, we are given items with positive values and positive integer weights. We want to pick subsets with maximum total value (i.e., ) such that the total weights of and are at most and , respectively. Assume that every item fits in either knapsack (i.e., for every item ). Consider the following two algorithmic approaches.
