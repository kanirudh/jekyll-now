## Precision Time Protocol

Used to sync clock between a master and a slave, PTP can correct the phase between the two clocks. Multiple slaves can sync to a single master and multiple master can negotiate
to determine the best master.

Slaves used timestamps from master to correct their local clocks.

#### Two methods of implementation

1. Hardware Timestamps



## syncE (Synchronous Ethernet)

It is used for frequency transfer over the ethernet.
