Tshark is such an awesome tools when investigating pcap files on the terminal.
And I don't find it lacking in any way from when using the wireshark UI, the underlying library is the same.

This is just a reference to some basic commands that I find useful

#### Read a summary of the file
tshark -r <pcap_file>

#### Print the each packet
tshark -Vx -r <pcap_file>

#### Apply some filters
tshark -r <pcap_file> "filters"

Lets say you want to filter on the frame number
tshark -Vx -r <pcap_file> "frame.number == 1"

Filter based on the ip, port
tshark -r <pcap_file> "ip.addr == 10.168.87.69 && tcp.port == 30003"

#### Enable absolute timestamps
tshark -t a -r <pcap_file>


#### Enable/Disable TCP Relative sequence numbers
tshark -o -o tcp.relative_sequence_numbers:FALSE -r <pcap_file>
